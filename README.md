3d-album
========

- A minimalistic and clean 3D Album using OpenGL and C++.
- This project was intended to serve as a small course project for CprE 557 at ISU.
- XCode project file could be found in the ./build directory.
- You can use cmake to generate the project for QT. Make sure to change the data path "dirName variable" in "app.cpp".
- Currently, the project loads all PNGs in the data folder, but it could be changed easily to open any image type. Check the App::loadImages() function.
